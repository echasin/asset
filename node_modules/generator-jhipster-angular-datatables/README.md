> JHipster module to change default grid(table) for all or selected entities with angular-datatables. 

## Usage

This is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

You can choose to change default grid(table) for all or selected entities with [angular-datatables](https://l-lin.github.io/angular-datatables).  

### Installation

As this is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, we expect you have [JHipster and its related tools already installed](http://jhipster.github.io/installation.html).

This module requires Jhipster version greater than 3.0 in order to work, and I fixed errors for compatibility and tested with the new Jhipster v4.*.

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-angular-datatables
```

Then run the module on a JHipster generated application:

```bash
yo jhipster-angular-datatables
```

If you want don't want to answer each question you can use

```bash
yo jhipster-angular-datatables default
```

### Style

All css class used in generator template are based in AdminLTE Template [AdminLTE].

```bash
<section class="content-header">
<div class="box">
<div class="box-header">
<div class="box-body">
```
